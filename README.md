# Recognizing the hand-written digits using neural networks

This project was completed as a part of the Honors portion of the [Advanced Learning Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms) Course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

Credit to DeepLearning.AI, Stanford, and the Coursera platform for providing the course materials and guidance.

## Objective

In this project, I employed a neural network to successfully identify two handwritten digits, specifically zero and one. The primary objective was to accomplish a binary classification task. Handwritten digit recognition has become increasingly prevalent in various applications, such as identifying zip codes on mail envelopes and recognizing handwritten amounts on bank checks. As part of a forthcoming assignment, I plan to further enhance the network's capabilities to recognize all ten digits (0-9).
